## About LabourJoin.net - Business Automated tools

In this project, I have developed a dynamic and user friendly website for casual job offering agencies. My project is dedicated to connect 
the people. The Workers will sign up to the system and create their profiles. Company will post their job, create job request and
send the job request to the job agency. Once the job agency got the job requests, they will allocate workers to that job requets and send work offer
to the workers. Workers will confirm the request. Once the job completed Company will fill up the time table for workers, based on the time 
table Job agency transfer the money to Workers.
