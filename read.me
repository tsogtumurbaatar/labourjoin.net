## About ICProject

In this project, I have developed a dynamic and user friendly website for 2thinknow Innovations Cities. Our project is about developing a database for the users so that the users can analyze geographical locations of industries. The user will be able to see the present cityâ€™s innovation potential and compare with other cities. The website will be viewed and accessed by the registered users. So the user will have to register to log into the website. Once the user will be logged in, they can select country, then city, factor, segment and indicators. Then the user will be able to view three different types of graphs which will compare indicators of different cities. The graphs could be Bar graph, Column graph and Line graph. Also the user will be able to PDF, print, email and export these graphs to excel. This project is an academic project, so the project is divided into two semesters.
